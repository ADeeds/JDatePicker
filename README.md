> For some strange reason, there just ain't really a lot of decent, Open Source date pickers available for the Java platform. JDatePicker is making up for this ;) ![Five stars](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JDatePicker/JDatePicker/master/site/stars.png)

About
-----
This project started in April 2004 before there existed so many swing components for date selection. Back in the day sourceforge.net was a popular source code hosting service. But since then github.com emerged, since git is the latest craze the project has now moved here.

Forks and pull requests are welcome. Also please submit issues on the github issue page, this is the preferred way of getting help.

Hopefully we can get central maven repo going again, but first, we will need to get a new version out into the wild, it's been a while.
